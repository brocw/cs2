Backtracking

Big Picture: We may find the solution before exploring everything!

Uses a Tree-like structure

N-Queens:
- Chess board, want to place queens so that no two queens are in the same row, column, or diagonal.
- n queens on nxn board

Example 4x4 solution:
__x_
x___
___x
_x__ 

Start with empty board.
If a branch doesn't collapse (shown false), continue with the recursive tree.
Once a branch is shown false, go back and try again. (Can even go back to the beginning!)
Go one by one, place in every possible cell in column.
Once a feasible solution is found, return. If not, go back.

Runtime: O(n * n!)
