B-Trees

Insertion:
- Perform a similar BST Insertion
    - Goal is to reach Leaf Node
    - As we traverse down the tree to a leaf node, we may have to prepare the tree for balancing.
- Once we reach Leaf, insert the key.
BF - t
min = t - 1
max = 2t - 1

1 3 5 7 9 (Insert 10, t = 3)
         ---5---
        1 3    7 9 10
As the max is 5 (2(3) - 1), need to split the Node.

Deletion:
- If leaf, just delete
- If internal node:
    -
