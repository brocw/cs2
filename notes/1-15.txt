Divide and Conquer

Quick and Merge Sort (n log n)
Binary Search (log n)

Base Case: When problem is small enough, brute force using n^2 algorithm

Closest Pair of Points

Naive; n^2 brute force (compare all points to all other points)

Points as set on 2D Plane
Each set as an (x, y) Pair
Distance calculated using normal distance equation

Algorithm:
- Sort points with nlogn algorithm (Merge, Quick Sort)
- Find the closest pair on the left side and the right side.
Divide plane in half, check on both sides for closest points
delta = min(point1, point2)
Base Case: Each divided segment of plane has 2 or 3 points
When you find a result smaller than delta, stop
