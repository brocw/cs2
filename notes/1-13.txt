Recurrence Relations

Recurrence: Equation or inequality that expresses the value of a function in terms of its value on smaller input size.

T(n): O(1)          n = 1
      2T(n/2) + n   n > 1

Solving:
- Iterative (in CS1)
- Recursion Tree & Substitution Method (not covered)
- Master Theorem (in CS2)

Master Theorem: The 'Cookbook'
T(n) = aT(n/b) + f(n)
where a >= 1 and b > 1 are constant and f(n) is an asymptotically positive function
